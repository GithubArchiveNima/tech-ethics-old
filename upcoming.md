## April 2, 2019: Freedom of Information and Privacy

**Meetup link: TBD**

- What type of information should private companies be able to collect?
- How transparent should companies be when informing users on the information that is collected and extrapolated?
- When it comes to protecting our personal information and accessing the information that others have gathered on us, what are our rights?

In this week's session we'll be exploring the world of privacy! We'll dive into the laws that protect our information and privacy rights in BC, and learn about the effects of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union.

Here are a couple places to get started on reading up for the session:
