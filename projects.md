One of the goals of this meetup group is to collaborate in building ethical and socially minded technology.

## [Diversity Boost - A Chrome Extension](https://github.com/NimaBoscarino/diversity-boost)

This Google Chrome extension gives users the ability to boost particular users in their Twitter timeline.

The goal of **Diversity Boost** is to address our own inherent biases and prejudices that are perpetuated by the way that social media caters content to us. Instead, we choose to expose ourselves to voices that the Twitter (or Netflix, Youtube, Facebook, etc.) algorithm hides from us.

One ideal use case for this extension is to track engagement habits (likes, retweets, etc.) both with and without the Diversity Boost enabled to see if we exhibit measurable differences in behaviour.
