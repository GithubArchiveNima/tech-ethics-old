With new tech entering the zeitgeist faster than ever, it’s important for consumers and developers of tech alike to be aware of the subtle effects that different technologies have in our society. In this meetup series we’ll look at some of the surprising ways that technology and ethics bump into each other, and and then come up with some guidelines and practices that developers can use to promote an ethical tech sector.

Details for upcoming sessions can be found on the [Devhub Vancouver Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/DevhubVancouver).

These sessions are hosted in Vancouver by me, Nima Boscarino!
