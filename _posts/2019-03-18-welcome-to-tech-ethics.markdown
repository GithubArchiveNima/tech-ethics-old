## Anthropomorphic Tech

Here are the notes from our meeting on March 20th, 2019.

### Details

Why are so many personal assistants gendered to be female by default?
What human qualities are robot care-takers designed to exhibit?
What are the social implications of products like sex robots?
What does it mean to be human?

As AI advances, many products are being built with human features as a core part of their design. In this session, we'll dive into what that means, and explore the decisions and conversations that arise as a result of this.
